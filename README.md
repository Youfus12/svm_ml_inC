# Naive Bayes Visualization

This project provides a visualization of the Naive Bayes classifier algorithm. It uses C and the SDL library to visualize the classification process, making it easier to understand how Naive Bayes works.

## Features

- Visual representation of Naive Bayes classification.
- Supports both Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows environments.
- Configured with CMake for easy build and configuration.

## Requirements

### For Linux:

- Ubuntu or other Linux-based operating systems.
- CMake (installed on your system).
- SDL2 library.
- g++ compiler (or equivalent).

### For Windows:

- Visual Studio Code (with C++ and CMake extensions).
